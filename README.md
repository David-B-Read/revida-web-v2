# revida-web-v2

As a learning exercise to gain more front end development experience, I decided to re-write the static HTML website for revida.co.uk using React components.

##### Plans for future development

- Revamp the legacy CSS to provide a responsive layout
- Use SASS or another modern CSS framework to generate the output
- Investigate using React Router
